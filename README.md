# Python Data Structures implementation

FOSDEM 2017 presentation. Link [here](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/python_data_structures/)

> list, dict: how does CPython implement them?

> > When writing Python code, you might find yourself using lists and dictionaries
> > pretty often. But do you really know how they work? Fortunately, their
> > implementation as well as their history are (really) well documented. In this
> > presentation, we will dive into CPython 3.6 internals, explain how these data
> > structures have been designed, how they behave (and why).
